# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the last of the Free Code Camp microservice projects - File Metadata. Added the Readme for this as well as previous microservice projects. General cleanup.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Ditching the comfort zone and trying to build an app with Koa instead of Express. Mostly reading today, stood up a super basic Koa server that will be the future home of the Free Code Camp Voting App.

**Thoughts:** Completely underestimated the ammount of reading required to start understaind Koa vs Express. Getting out of my comfort zone is good. Generators seem fun!

### Day 3: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from Koa/Voting App to learn about JS driven, 60fps animations.

**Thoughts:** Browser based animation can be amazing when combining CSS and JS. Otherwise, exhausting day. Need to be more prudent about setting aside enough time for this challenge.

**Link(s) to Work:**  
None.  

### Day 4: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the entire Kick-Off-Koa series to get a focused overview of the library.

**Thoughts:** I think I have enough base Koa knowledge to start roughing out the architecture for the Free Code Camp Voting App. Onward and upward!

### Day 5: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added the front-end architecture to the voting app. Materialize, jQuery, Pug.

**Thoughts:** Enjoying the light weight of Koa. Although I'm seeing the potential for the ultra-modular nature of Koa being annoying vs the "well-rounded" out of the box functionality of Express. Definitely looking forward to how the dev experience with Koa continues...

### Day 6: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added an external mongodb connection. Setup Registration form and verified connection with database. Learned A LOT about user authentication.

**Thoughts:** Lots of reading/learning today on user authentication, WHEW! Part of my strategy for the FCC Voting app is to do everything at a low level and avoid relying on node modules for everything (Passport.js). While I have added a few modules, they've been for things that I don't consider to be on the main learning path for this project.

### Day 7: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued learning on user authentication on a low level. Roughed out the user login route for the voting app.

**Thoughts:** More user auth learning. Getting more comfortable in the Koa patterns using yields.
