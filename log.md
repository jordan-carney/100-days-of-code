# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the last of the Free Code Camp microservice projects - File Metadata. Added the Readme for this as well as previous microservice projects. General cleanup.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
