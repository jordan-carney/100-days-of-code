# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the last of the Free Code Camp microservice projects - File Metadata. Added the Readme for this as well as previous microservice projects. General cleanup.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link(s) to Work:**

2. [App Demo: File Metadata](https://jc-fcc-file-meta.herokuapp.com/)

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Ditching the comfort zone and trying to build an app with Koa instead of Express. Mostly reading today, stood up a super basic Koa server that will be the future home of the Free Code Camp Voting App.

**Thoughts:** Completely underestimated the ammount of reading required to start understaind Koa vs Express. Getting out of my comfort zone is good. Generators seem fun!
