# 117 Days Of Code - Log
*Added 21 days due to sick-time, and various other days missed.

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the last of the Free Code Camp microservice projects - File Metadata. Added the Readme for this as well as previous microservice projects. General cleanup.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Ditching the comfort zone and trying to build an app with Koa instead of Express. Mostly reading today, stood up a super basic Koa server that will be the future home of the Free Code Camp Voting App.

**Thoughts:** Completely underestimated the ammount of reading required to start understaind Koa vs Express. Getting out of my comfort zone is good. Generators seem fun!

### Day 3: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from Koa/Voting App to learn about JS driven, 60fps animations.

**Thoughts:** Browser based animation can be amazing when combining CSS and JS. Otherwise, exhausting day. Need to be more prudent about setting aside enough time for this challenge.

**Link(s) to Work:**  
None.  

### Day 4: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the entire Kick-Off-Koa series to get a focused overview of the library.

**Thoughts:** I think I have enough base Koa knowledge to start roughing out the architecture for the Free Code Camp Voting App. Onward and upward!

### Day 5: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added the front-end architecture to the voting app. Materialize, jQuery, Pug.

**Thoughts:** Enjoying the light weight of Koa. Although I'm seeing the potential for the ultra-modular nature of Koa being annoying vs the "well-rounded" out of the box functionality of Express. Definitely looking forward to how the dev experience with Koa continues...

### Day 6: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added an external mongodb connection. Setup Registration form and verified connection with database. Learned A LOT about user authentication.

**Thoughts:** Lots of reading/learning today on user authentication, WHEW! Part of my strategy for the FCC Voting app is to do everything at a low level and avoid relying on node modules for everything (Passport.js). While I have added a few modules, they've been for things that I don't consider to be on the main learning path for this project.

### Day 7: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued learning on user authentication on a low level. Roughed out the user login route for the voting app.

**Thoughts:** More user auth learning. Getting more comfortable in the Koa patterns using yields.

### Day 8: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Implemented user session/cookies on login and removal on logout.

**Thoughts:** Today I was reminded to be flexible and willing to adjust approach in order to get things done.

### Day 9: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Implemented Hash on user passwords for more secure storage.

**Thoughts:** Today revealed some blind spots in my async/await | generator control flow knowledge.

### Day 10: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Implemented csrf protection via form tokens.

**Thoughts:** Long days make this commitment hard to complete. May have to take some ligher styling/css days to get through these longer days.

### Day 11, 12, 13, 14: January 13 - 16, 2017

**Progress**: Took a detour and wrote an introductory presentation about D3.js I'll be giving on February 2nd.

**Thoughts:** This will be my first developer style presentation I've ever given, so I'm honestly a bit nervous.

**Link(s) to Work:**  
Will update with slide-deck after the talk.

### Day 15: January 17, 2017

**Progress**: None.

**Thoughts**: Family and general adulting simply took priority today. Life is a balance and sometimes that means making hard compromises. Back at it again tomorrow!

### Day 16: January 18, 2017

**Progress**: Added a general account overview route and cleaned up the styles for the Voting App.

**Thoughts**: User authentication is still oddly fun and intriguing for me. Definitely didn't expect that...

### Day 17, 18: January 19, 20, 2017

**Progress**: Cleaned up the logged-in home page. Roughed out the basic data model for Polls. Added Route to create Polls.

**Thoughts**: Life continues to be crazy, but this challenge is helping to keep me honest. Ship code daily, or at least write daily and ship when I can!

### Day 38: February 8th, 2017

**Progress**: Uploaded the app to heroku for public viewing of progress as I continue.

### Day 40: February 10th, 2017

### Day 41: February 11th, 2017

**Progress**: Realized that many of my commits were not counting in the Github streak graph due to a computer I set up that had a bad (local) email address being used. Took a trip down Git-lane and learned about rewriting commit history in a repo.

**Thoughts**: Git is powerful, and it's easy to make a big mess if not vigalent.
