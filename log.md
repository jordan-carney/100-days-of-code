# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the last of the Free Code Camp microservice projects - File Metadata. Added the Readme for this as well as previous microservice projects. General cleanup.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Ditching the comfort zone and trying to build an app with Koa instead of Express. Mostly reading today, stood up a super basic Koa server that will be the future home of the Free Code Camp Voting App.

**Thoughts:** Completely underestimated the ammount of reading required to start understaind Koa vs Express. Getting out of my comfort zone is good. Generators seem fun!

### Day 3: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from Koa/Voting App to learn about JS driven, 60fps animations.

**Thoughts:** Browser based animation can be amazing when combining CSS and JS. Otherwise, exhausting day. Need to be more prudent about setting aside enough time for this challenge.

**Link(s) to Work:**  
None.  

### Day 4: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the entire Kick-Off-Koa series to get a focused overview of the library.

**Thoughts:** I think I have enough base Koa knowledge to start roughing out the architecture for the Free Code Camp Voting App. Onward and upward!
